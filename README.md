# multi-robot-area-covering
University of Pennsylvania ESE 519 Embedded System Project
This project is trying to use multi-robot cooperation to cover an area. Two robots are working at the beginning and the other one is charging and waiting. Two robots start working from two sides. When one of them is running out of charge. It will send its current location to master and master will tell Robot 3 where to go and where to stop. After Robot 3 goes to the position where another robot left, it takes that one's job and continues area covering in zigzag format.
